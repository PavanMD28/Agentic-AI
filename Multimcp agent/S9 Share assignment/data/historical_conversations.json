It was founded by Chaudhary Raghvendra Singh in 1946, and it is based in New Delhi, India.[2][3] DLF has developed residential colonies in Delhi such as Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Krishna Nagar, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony, and Hauz Khas. DLF builds residential, office, and retail properties.[4][5] With the passage of the Delhi Development Act in 1957, the local government assumed control of real estate development and banned private real estate developers from Delhi proper. As a result, DLF began acquiring land at a relatively low cost outside the area controlled by the Delhi Development Authority, in the district of Gurgaon, and in the adjacent state of Haryana. In the mid-1970s, the company started developing their DLF City project at Gurgaon. This included hotels, infrastructure, and special economic zones-related development projects. The company is headed by Rajiv Singh, who is the current chairman of the DLF Group. According to the Forbes listing of richest billionaires in 2023, Kushal Pal Singh, Chairman Emeritus, is the 19th richest man in India with a net worth of US$8.8 billion. The company\\'s $US$2 billion IPO in July 2007 was India\\'s biggest IPO in history.[6] In its first quarter results for the period ending 30 June 2007, the company reported a turnover of \u20b931.2098 billion (US$360 million) and profit after taxes of \u20b915.1548 billion (US$180 million).[7] As of 31 March 2012, the company had 1,380 square feet of leased retail space across the country.[8] In 2013-14, it leased out 3 million sq ft of office space in India.[9][10] History DLF\\'s first residential project was Krishna Nagar in East Delhi, which was completed in 1949. Subsequently, the company developed 21 colonies in Delhi, including Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Punjabi Bagh, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony and Hauz Khas. The passage of Delhi Development Act in 1957 was the first serious challenge to company\\'s growth. The Act meant that the government would assume control of all real estate development activities in the city.[11] As a result, DLF decided to move beyond Delhi and focused on the suburb of Gurgaon in Haryana,[12] which had the potential for development of residential and commercial properties. As DLF started to acquire land under the leadership of Chairman K.P. Singh, Gurgaon embarked on a period of rapid growth.[13] A \u20b958 crore deal was cancelled between DLF and Robert Vadra by IAS officer Ashok Khemka.[14] Sponsorship In 2008, DLF became the title sponsor of the Indian Premier League, a newly formed Twenty20 cricket league. DLF paid close to \u20b92 billion (US$23 million) for the five-year sponsorship deal.[15] The deal ended in the 2012 version of the season, wherein it was taken over by Pepsi. Beyond buildings Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) and DLF, in a 50:50 joint venture, have completed work on a 16-lane, 10.5 km road network in Gurgaon. This stretch from NH8 Toll Plaza to Sector 55/56 in Gurgaon with six underpasses, one flyover and freeways has improved traffic management in the city.[16] To create this\\\\n[Source: dlf.md, ID: dlf_0]\", annotations=None)] isError=False'}",

It was founded by Chaudhary Raghvendra Singh in 1946, and it is based in New Delhi, India.[2][3] DLF has developed residential colonies in Delhi such as Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Krishna Nagar, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony, and Hauz Khas. DLF builds residential, office, and retail properties.[4][5] With the passage of the Delhi Development Act in 1957, the local government assumed control of real estate development and banned private real estate developers from Delhi proper. As a result, DLF began acquiring land at a relatively low cost outside the area controlled by the Delhi Development Authority, in the district of Gurgaon, and in the adjacent state of Haryana. In the mid-1970s, the company started developing their DLF City project at Gurgaon. This included hotels, infrastructure, and special economic zones-related development projects. The company is headed by Rajiv Singh, who is the current chairman of the DLF Group. According to the Forbes listing of richest billionaires in 2023, Kushal Pal Singh, Chairman Emeritus, is the 19th richest man in India with a net worth of US$8.8 billion. The company\\'s $US$2 billion IPO in July 2007 was India\\'s biggest IPO in history.[6] In its first quarter results for the period ending 30 June 2007, the company reported a turnover of \u20b931.2098 billion (US$360 million) and profit after taxes of \u20b915.1548 billion (US$180 million).[7] As of 31 March 2012, the company had 1,380 square feet of leased retail space across the country.[8] In 2013-14, it leased out 3 million sq ft of office space in India.[9][10] History DLF\\'s first residential project was Krishna Nagar in East Delhi, which was completed in 1949. Subsequently, the company developed 21 colonies in Delhi, including Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Punjabi Bagh, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony and Hauz Khas. The passage of Delhi Development Act in 1957 was the first serious challenge to company\\'s growth. The Act meant that the government would assume control of all real estate development activities in the city.[11] As a result, DLF decided to move beyond Delhi and focused on the suburb of Gurgaon in Haryana,[12] which had the potential for development of residential and commercial properties. As DLF started to acquire land under the leadership of Chairman K.P. Singh, Gurgaon embarked on a period of rapid growth.[13] A \u20b958 crore deal was cancelled between DLF and Robert Vadra by IAS officer Ashok Khemka.[14] Sponsorship In 2008, DLF became the title sponsor of the Indian Premier League, a newly formed Twenty20 cricket league. DLF paid close to \u20b92 billion (US$23 million) for the five-year sponsorship deal.[15] The deal ended in the 2012 version of the season, wherein it was taken over by Pepsi. Beyond buildings Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) and DLF, in a 50:50 joint venture, have completed work on a 16-lane, 10.5 km road network in Gurgaon. This stretch from NH8 Toll Plaza to Sector 55/56 in Gurgaon with six underpasses, one flyover and freeways has improved traffic management in the city.[16] To create this\\\\n[Source: dlf.md, ID: dlf_0]\", annotations=None)] isError=False'}",

It was founded by Chaudhary Raghvendra Singh in 1946, and it is based in New Delhi, India.[2][3] DLF has developed residential colonies in Delhi such as Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Krishna Nagar, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony, and Hauz Khas. DLF builds residential, office, and retail properties.[4][5] With the passage of the Delhi Development Act in 1957, the local government assumed control of real estate development and banned private real estate developers from Delhi proper. As a result, DLF began acquiring land at a relatively low cost outside the area controlled by the Delhi Development Authority, in the district of Gurgaon, and in the adjacent state of Haryana. In the mid-1970s, the company started developing their DLF City project at Gurgaon. This included hotels, infrastructure, and special economic zones-related development projects. The company is headed by Rajiv Singh, who is the current chairman of the DLF Group. According to the Forbes listing of richest billionaires in 2023, Kushal Pal Singh, Chairman Emeritus, is the 19th richest man in India with a net worth of US$8.8 billion. The company\\'s $US$2 billion IPO in July 2007 was India\\'s biggest IPO in history.[6] In its first quarter results for the period ending 30 June 2007, the company reported a turnover of \u20b931.2098 billion (US$360 million) and profit after taxes of \u20b915.1548 billion (US$180 million).[7] As of 31 March 2012, the company had 1,380 square feet of leased retail space across the country.[8] In 2013-14, it leased out 3 million sq ft of office space in India.[9][10] History DLF\\'s first residential project was Krishna Nagar in East Delhi, which was completed in 1949. Subsequently, the company developed 21 colonies in Delhi, including Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Punjabi Bagh, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony and Hauz Khas. The passage of Delhi Development Act in 1957 was the first serious challenge to company\\'s growth. The Act meant that the government would assume control of all real estate development activities in the city.[11] As a result, DLF decided to move beyond Delhi and focused on the suburb of Gurgaon in Haryana,[12] which had the potential for development of residential and commercial properties. As DLF started to acquire land under the leadership of Chairman K.P. Singh, Gurgaon embarked on a period of rapid growth.[13] A \u20b958 crore deal was cancelled between DLF and Robert Vadra by IAS officer Ashok Khemka.[14] Sponsorship In 2008, DLF became the title sponsor of the Indian Premier League, a newly formed Twenty20 cricket league. DLF paid close to \u20b92 billion (US$23 million) for the five-year sponsorship deal.[15] The deal ended in the 2012 version of the season, wherein it was taken over by Pepsi. Beyond buildings Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) and DLF, in a 50:50 joint venture, have completed work on a 16-lane, 10.5 km road network in Gurgaon. This stretch from NH8 Toll Plaza to Sector 55/56 in Gurgaon with six underpasses, one flyover and freeways has improved traffic management in the city.[16] To create this\\\\n[Source: dlf.md, ID: dlf_0]\", annotations=None)] isError=False'}",

There have also been a number of open source initiatives in respect of individual clean technology projects. More recently, the World Intellectual Property Organization has established WIPO Green to promote the diffusion of green technology. [79] Eric Lane, a Law Professor at the Thomas Jefferson School of Law, considered the strategy of Tesla Motors in the Green Patent Blog. [80] He considered the precedent of the Eco-Patent Commons, and its mixed success. Lane observed: \u2018So the Tesla-Patent Commons is very significant, and unlike any prior (small \u201ce\u201d) eco-patent commons, but the commercial and legal realities of dealing with patents and positioning technological businesses to be free to operate are always extremely complex.\u2019 [81] He commented upon the gambit by Tesla Motors: \u2018Ultimately, the impact of Musk\u2019s decision may turn on to what extent other such players will be motivated to invest in manufacturing vehicles, batteries, etc. using Tesla\u2019s patented and patent-pending technology with the obvious upside being the proven innovation that technology brings and the down side being no exclusivity, instead of investing in their own R&D and patent protection where the upside may be exclusivity and the down side may be inferior or unproven technologies.\u2019 [82] Don Tapscott and Anthony Williams have argued for the use of open source strategies in respect of clean technologies. In their 2010 book MacroWikinomics, Tapscott and Williams 79 WIPO GREEN, https://www3.wipo.int/wipogreen/en/about/ 80 Eric Lane, \u2018Elon Musk Launches the Tesla-Patent Commons\u2019, *The Green Patent Blog*, 14 June 2014, http://www.greenpatentblog.com/2014/06/14/elon - musk - launches - the - tesla - patent - commons/ 81 Ibid. 82 Ibid. 23 ----- ## called for the establishment of a green technology commons. [83] The pair recognised: \u2018It is quickly becoming clear that climate change will be the biggest issue that human civilisation has ever had to deal with.\u2019 [84] Tapscott and Williams were concerned about the limitations of existing responses to the problem of climate change. The writers promoted open and collaborative responses to climate change: \u2018Tackling climate change will not only require unprecedented transformations in our systems of commerce and industry, it will also require fundamental changes\\\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_11]\\', annotations=None), TextContent(type=\\'text\\', text=\\'been removed, in the spirit of the open source movement, for the advancement of electric vehicle technology. [11] ## Elon Musk observed that \u2018Tesla Motors was created to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport.\u2019 [12] He maintained: \u2018If we clear a path to the creation of compelling electric vehicles, but then lay intellectual property landmines behind us to inhibit others, we are acting in a manner contrary to that goal.\u2019 [13] Elon Musk promised: \u2018Tesla will not initiate patent lawsuits against anyone who, in good faith, wants to use our technology.\u2019 [14] This statement has attracted a wide range of interest, because it raises important issues in respect of intellectual property; open source strategies; business; and innovation in clean technologies to address climate change. 10 Elon Musk, \u2018All Our Patents Belong to You\u2019, Tesla Motors, 12 June 2014, http://www.teslamotors.com/blog/all - our - patent - are - belong - you 11 Ibid, 12 Ibid. 13 Ibid. 14 Ibid. 5 ----- ## This paper will consider Tesla Motors, and evaluate its statements in respect of intellectual property, open innovation, and climate change. It is worth situating the story in the context of the growing literature on intellectual property and clean technologies. Professor Peter Menell from the University of California, Berkeley, and Sarah Tran reviewed the canon of key articles in the field in Intellectual Property, Innovation, and the Environment . [ 15] Scottish scholar Abbe Brown has edited a number of contemporary papers on intellectual property and climate change. [16] Professor Estelle Derclaye from the University of Nottingham has written widely on intellectual property and climate change in the European Union. [17] Professor Tine Summer from Aarhus University, Denmark, has explored the patenting of environmentally sound technologies. [18] The International Centre for Trade and Sustainable Development - in collaboration with the European Patent Office and the United Nations Environment Programme - has focused upon patent landscapes and clean technologies.

Two players from the batting team, the striker and nonstriker, stand in front of either wicket holding bats, while one player from the fielding team, the bowler, bowls the ball toward the striker\\\\\\'s wicket from the opposite end of the pitch. The striker\\\\\\'s goal is to hit the bowled ball with the bat and then switch places with the nonstriker, with the batting team scoring one run for each of these exchanges. Runs are also scored when the ball reaches the boundary of the field or when the ball is bowled illegally. The fielding team aims to prevent runs by dismissing batters (so they are \"out\"). Dismissal can occur in various ways, including being bowled (when the ball hits the striker\\\\\\'s wicket and dislodges the bails), and by the fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat but before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease line in front of the wicket. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings (playing phase) ends and the teams swap roles. Forms of cricket range from traditional Test matches played over five days to the newer Twenty20 format (also known as T20), in which each team bats for a single innings of 20 overs (each \"over\" being a set of 6 fair opportunities for the batting team to score) and the game generally lasts three to four hours. Traditionally, cricketers play in all-white kit, but in limited overs cricket, they wear club or team colours.\\\\n[Source: cricket.txt, ID: cricket_0]\\', annotations=None)] isError=False'}",

Two players from the batting team, the striker and nonstriker, stand in front of either wicket holding bats, while one player from the fielding team, the bowler, bowls the ball toward the striker\\\\\\'s wicket from the opposite end of the pitch. The striker\\\\\\'s goal is to hit the bowled ball with the bat and then switch places with the nonstriker, with the batting team scoring one run for each of these exchanges. Runs are also scored when the ball reaches the boundary of the field or when the ball is bowled illegally. The fielding team aims to prevent runs by dismissing batters (so they are \"out\"). Dismissal can occur in various ways, including being bowled (when the ball hits the striker\\\\\\'s wicket and dislodges the bails), and by the fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat but before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease line in front of the wicket. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings (playing phase) ends and the teams swap roles. Forms of cricket range from traditional Test matches played over five days to the newer Twenty20 format (also known as T20), in which each team bats for a single innings of 20 overs (each \"over\" being a set of 6 fair opportunities for the batting team to score) and the game generally lasts three to four hours. Traditionally, cricketers play in all-white kit, but in limited overs cricket, they wear club or team colours.\\\\n[Source: cricket.txt, ID: cricket_0]\\', annotations=None)] isError=False'}",

It was founded by Chaudhary Raghvendra Singh in 1946, and it is based in New Delhi, India.[2][3] DLF has developed residential colonies in Delhi such as Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Krishna Nagar, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony, and Hauz Khas. DLF builds residential, office, and retail properties.[4][5] With the passage of the Delhi Development Act in 1957, the local government assumed control of real estate development and banned private real estate developers from Delhi proper. As a result, DLF began acquiring land at a relatively low cost outside the area controlled by the Delhi Development Authority, in the district of Gurgaon, and in the adjacent state of Haryana. In the mid-1970s, the company started developing their DLF City project at Gurgaon. This included hotels, infrastructure, and special economic zones-related development projects. The company is headed by Rajiv Singh, who is the current chairman of the DLF Group. According to the Forbes listing of richest billionaires in 2023, Kushal Pal Singh, Chairman Emeritus, is the 19th richest man in India with a net worth of US$8.8 billion. The company\\'s $US$2 billion IPO in July 2007 was India\\'s biggest IPO in history.[6] In its first quarter results for the period ending 30 June 2007, the company reported a turnover of \u20b931.2098 billion (US$360 million) and profit after taxes of \u20b915.1548 billion (US$180 million).[7] As of 31 March 2012, the company had 1,380 square feet of leased retail space across the country.[8] In 2013-14, it leased out 3 million sq ft of office space in India.[9][10] History DLF\\'s first residential project was Krishna Nagar in East Delhi, which was completed in 1949. Subsequently, the company developed 21 colonies in Delhi, including Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Punjabi Bagh, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony and Hauz Khas. The passage of Delhi Development Act in 1957 was the first serious challenge to company\\'s growth. The Act meant that the government would assume control of all real estate development activities in the city.[11] As a result, DLF decided to move beyond Delhi and focused on the suburb of Gurgaon in Haryana,[12] which had the potential for development of residential and commercial properties. As DLF started to acquire land under the leadership of Chairman K.P. Singh, Gurgaon embarked on a period of rapid growth.[13] A \u20b958 crore deal was cancelled between DLF and Robert Vadra by IAS officer Ashok Khemka.[14] Sponsorship In 2008, DLF became the title sponsor of the Indian Premier League, a newly formed Twenty20 cricket league. DLF paid close to \u20b92 billion (US$23 million) for the five-year sponsorship deal.[15] The deal ended in the 2012 version of the season, wherein it was taken over by Pepsi. Beyond buildings Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) and DLF, in a 50:50 joint venture, have completed work on a 16-lane, 10.5 km road network in Gurgaon. This stretch from NH8 Toll Plaza to Sector 55/56 in Gurgaon with six underpasses, one flyover and freeways has improved traffic management in the city.[16] To create this\\\\n[Source: dlf.md, ID: dlf_0]\", annotations=None)] isError=False'}",

The company\\'s $US$2 billion IPO in July 2007 was India\\'s biggest IPO in history.[6] In its first quarter results for the period ending 30 June 2007, the company reported a turnover of \u20b931.2098 billion (US$360 million) and profit after taxes of \u20b915.1548 billion (US$180 million).[7] As of 31 March 2012, the company had 1,380 square feet of leased retail space across the country.[8] In 2013-14, it leased out 3 million sq ft of office space in India.[9][10] History DLF\\'s first residential project was Krishna Nagar in East Delhi, which was completed in 1949. Subsequently, the company developed 21 colonies in Delhi, including Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Punjabi Bagh, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony and Hauz Khas. The passage of Delhi Development Act in 1957 was the first serious challenge to company\\'s growth. The Act meant that the government would assume control of all real estate development activities in the city.[11] As a result, DLF decided to move beyond Delhi and focused on the suburb of Gurgaon in Haryana,[12] which had the potential for development of residential and commercial properties. As DLF started to acquire land under the leadership of Chairman K.P. Singh, Gurgaon embarked on a period of rapid growth.[13] A \u20b958 crore deal was cancelled between DLF and Robert Vadra by IAS officer Ashok Khemka.[14] Sponsorship In 2008, DLF became the title sponsor of the Indian Premier League, a newly formed Twenty20 cricket league. DLF paid close to \u20b92 billion (US$23 million) for the five-year sponsorship deal.[15] The deal ended in the 2012 version of the season, wherein it was taken over by Pepsi. Beyond buildings Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) and DLF, in a 50:50 joint venture, have completed work on a 16-lane, 10.5 km road network in Gurgaon. This stretch from NH8 Toll Plaza to Sector 55/56 in Gurgaon with six underpasses, one flyover and freeways has improved traffic management in the city.[16] To create this\\\\n[Source: dlf.md, ID: dlf_0]\", annotations=None)] isError=False'}",

Gensol was to provide an additional equity (margin) contribution of 20%, bringing the total expected deployment of approximately Rs. 829.86 Crore for the purchase of 6,400 Electric Vehicles. Based on these figures, an amount of Rs. 262.13 Crore (Rs. 829.86 Crore \u2013 Rs. 5 6 7.73 Crore) remains unaccounted, even though more than a year has pas se d since the Company availed the last tranche of the above mentioned financi n g . 28. Given the above, to understand the end-use of funds, bank statements of both the Company and the dealer, Go-Auto, were examined. The analysis showed that once the funds were transferred from Gensol to Go-Auto, ostensibly for the purchase of EVs, they were, in most of the instances, either transferred back to the Company itself or routed to entities that were directly or indirectly related to Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi, promoters and directors of Gensol. 29. Some of these funds were then used for purposes unrelated to the purpose/objective of the sanctioned term loans, which included (i) personal expenses of the promoter, including purchase of high-end real estate; (ii) benefit to the private promoter entities / transfer of funds to promoters\u2019 close relatives; etc. In order to demonstrate the nature and structure of these diversions/misutilization, the flow of funds from Gensol to Go-Auto and thereafter to entities connected to promoters of Gensol in the case of three of **___________________________________________________________________________ ** **Interim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited Page 8 of 29** ----- ### the above mentioned loans (viz. loans mentioned at serial numbers 3, 6 and 8 in the Table under Para 24), on sample basis, is discussed below. 30.

DLF builds residential, office, and retail properties.[4][5] With the passage of the Delhi Development Act in 1957, the local government assumed control of real estate development and banned private real estate developers from Delhi proper. As a result, DLF began acquiring land at a relatively low cost outside the area controlled by the Delhi Development Authority, in the district of Gurgaon, and in the adjacent state of Haryana. In the mid-1970s, the company started developing their DLF City project at Gurgaon. This included hotels, infrastructure, and special economic zones-related development projects. The company is headed by Rajiv Singh, who is the current chairman of the DLF Group. According to the Forbes listing of richest billionaires in 2023, Kushal Pal Singh, Chairman Emeritus, is the 19th richest man in India with a net worth of US$8.8 billion. The company\\'s $US$2 billion IPO in July 2007 was India\\'s biggest IPO in history.[6] In its first quarter results for the period ending 30 June 2007, the company reported a turnover of \u20b931.2098 billion (US$360 million) and profit after taxes of \u20b915.1548 billion (US$180 million).[7] As of 31 March 2012, the company had 1,380 square feet of leased retail space across the country.[8] In 2013-14, it leased out 3 million sq ft of office space in India.[9][10] History DLF\\'s first residential project was Krishna Nagar in East Delhi, which was completed in 1949. Subsequently, the company developed 21 colonies in Delhi, including Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Punjabi Bagh, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony and Hauz Khas. The passage of Delhi Development Act in 1957 was the first serious challenge to company\\'s growth. The Act meant that the government would assume control of all real estate development activities in the city.[11] As a result, DLF decided to move beyond Delhi and focused on the suburb of Gurgaon in Haryana,[12] which had the potential for development of residential and commercial properties. As DLF started to acquire land under the leadership of Chairman K.P. Singh, Gurgaon embarked on a period of rapid growth.[13] A \u20b958 crore deal was cancelled between DLF and Robert Vadra by IAS officer Ashok Khemka.[14] Sponsorship In 2008, DLF became the title sponsor of the Indian Premier League, a newly formed Twenty20 cricket league. DLF paid close to \u20b92 billion (US$23 million) for the five-year sponsorship deal.[15] The deal ended in the 2012 version of the season, wherein it was taken over by Pepsi. Beyond buildings Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) and DLF, in a 50:50 joint venture, have completed work on a 16-lane, 10.5 km road network in Gurgaon. This stretch from NH8 Toll Plaza to Sector 55/56 in Gurgaon with six underpasses, one flyover and freeways has improved traffic management in the city.[16] To create this\\\\n[Source: dlf.md, ID: dlf_0]\", annotations=None)] isError=False'}",

A journey just to catch glimpses of these mysterious, remote, savage giants is the trip of a lifetime for many and, for mountaineers, they\u2019re the ultimate challenge. Rising to way above 8,000m, they stretch through the best part of the Earth\u2019s troposphere, towards the thin air of the stratosphere, reaching heights usually associated with the cruising altitudes of airliners. Up here, conditions are brutal (so your down jackets and winter gloves need to be top-class). The cold is fierce, the oxygen is depleted and nothing survives for very long. All of the tallest mountains in the world are located in Asia, either in the Himalayas or the Karakorum ranges. Of the 10 highest, nine are found in Nepal, including the highest of all: Everest. What is the highest mountain in the world? The tallest mountain in the world is Mount Everest, at 8,849m (29,031ft) above sea level, in the Khumbu region of the Nepalese Himalayas. The mountain attracts mountaineers and trekkers from around the globe and, while its easiest routes are technically straightforward by mountaineering standards, its high altitude makes climbing it a hugely dangerous undertaking. It\u2019s known to the Nepalese as Sagarmatha \u2013 loosely translating as \\\\\\'The Head in the Heavens\\\\\\' \u2013 and to the Tibetans as Chomolungma (or Qomolangma) \u2013 loosely meaning \\\\\\'Goddess Mother\\\\\\'. Whatever the exact translations are, the local names are certainly more romantic than \u2018Everest\u2019, the name given to the mountain by the Royal Geographical Society in 1865 in honour of the surveyor George Everest, whose surname is actually pronounced eev-rist. Interestingly, Everest is not the tallest mountain in the world from base to peak. That accolade goes to Hawaii\u2019s Mauna Kea, which rises to 10,210m from bottom to top. So, why isn\u2019t Mauna Kea cited as the highest mountain in the world? Well, around 6,000m of Mauna Kea is underwater, with \\\\\\'only\\\\\\' 4,107m rising above sea level. Then there\u2019s Ecuador\u2019s 6,268m-high Chimborazo, the summit of which, thanks to the Earth\u2019s equatorial bulge, is the highest point from the centre of the planet and therefore the closest mountain to the stars. What are the tallest mountains on each continent? Aconcagua (6,961m), pictured here, is the highest mountain outside of Asia and the highest peak in the Americas \u00a9Almazoff/Shutterstock You may have heard of the Seven Summits, the seven highest peaks on each of the Earth\u2019s separate continents. Many adventurous souls make it their mission to bag each of these special peaks. They are: Asia: Mount Everest (8,849m)South America: Aconcagua (6,962m)North America: Denali (6,194m)Africa: Mount Kilimanjaro (5,895m)Europe: Mount Elbrus (5,642m)Antarctica: Vinson Massif (4,892m)Oceania: Puncak Jaya (Carstensz Pyramid) (4,884m) Everest is, of course, the highest mountain in Asia and easily the tallest in the Seven Summits list, almost 2,000m higher than its next rival: Aconcagua. Rising above all else in the Andes, Aconcagua is South America\u2019s highest peak. The legendary Denali in Alaska is North America\u2019s loftiest, measuring a whopping 5,500m from valley to summit and reaching a height of 6,194m above sea level. Denali is closely followed by Africa\u2019s iconic Mount Kilimanjaro, a massive dormant volcano and the world\u2019s highest free-standing mountain. Mount Elbrus, another dormant volcano, is Europe\u2019s tallest mountain, located in the Russian Caucasus. The vast, icy, polar desert of Antarctica is crowned by the Vinson Massif, while Oceania\u2019s loftiest point is Puncak Jaya (the Carstensz Pyramid) on New Guinea, the world\u2019s highest island peak. The 10 highest mountains in the world 1. Everest, Himalayas, Nepal Everest, the peak that\\\\\\'s furthest left in this image, is the highest mountain in the world at 8,848m \u00a9Daniel Prudek/Shutterstock Height: 8,849m (29,031ft)First ascent: 29 May 1953 by Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay The fact that Everest is the highest mountain in the world makes it an irresistible draw to so many. The subject of countless expeditions, daring adventures, stunning films and gripping novels, no other mountain on our planet holds such a fascination with the general public. The stories and names associated with the mountain echo through time: George Mallory, Sandy Irvine, Edmund Hillary, Tenzing Norgay, Tom Hornbein, Willi Unsoeld, Junko Tabei, Reinhold Messner, Peter Habeler, Joe Taker and Pete Boardman, to name just a few. These days, hundreds achieve the summit every year, most by the two main routes: the South Col Route from Nepal and the Northeast Ridge from Tibet. It\u2019s thought that around 300 people have died attempting to climb the mountain and many bodies remain unrecovered on the mountain. The wider Khumbu region is a hugely popular hiking arena, containing many world class hikes, including the iconic Everest Basecamp trek. 2. K2, Karakorum, Pakistan \u00a9Hussain Warraich/Shutterstock Height: 8,611m (28,251ft)First ascent: 31 July 1954 by Achille Compagnoni and Lino Lacedelli Cited as the \\\\\\'Savage Mountain\\\\\\' and the \\\\\\'Mountain of Mountains\\\\\\', K2 is the world\u2019s second highest peak and one of its most dangerous. It\u2019s also arguably the most spectacular of them all, an immense, soaring pyramid that calls like a siren to the mountaineering\u2019s elite. Located in Pakistan\u2019s Karakorum range, it\u2019s so remote that the original Western surveyors exploring the region couldn\u2019t find a local name for it. So, they temporarily titled it K2: K for Karakorum and 2 because it was the second prominent peak in a sketch by surveyor Thomas Montgomerie. The name stuck. The Italians claimed the first ascent, via the Abruzzi Spur, in 1954. Achille Compagnoni and Lino Lacedelli achieved the summit but it was the efforts of Walter Bonatti and his Hunza companion Amir Mehdi, forced into a controversial bivouac high up in the Death Zone, that have gone down in mountaineering folklore. For many years, the glittering prize of a winter ascent alluded the world\u2019s leading mountaineers until a successful Nepalese expedition, led by Nims Purja, placed 10 climbers on the summit in January 2021. 3. Kanchenjunga, Himalayas, Nepal \u00a9Rounov/Shutterstock Height: 8,586m (28,169ft)First ascent: 25 May 1955 by Joe Brown and George Band Kanchenjunga, the world\u2019s 3rd highest mountain, occupies the border between eastern Nepal and India and was once thought to the highest of them all. It\u2019s the only one of the world\u2019s 8,000m summits that the British can claim to have been the first to stand on, although some would point out that Hillary and Tenzing Norgay\u2019s 1953 Everest success was as part of a British expedition. Nevertheless, the first Britons to stand on one of the tallest mountains in the world were Joe Brown and George Band on Kanch (as it\u2019s affectionately known) in 1955. As the mountain is sacred to the Indian Sikkim people, Brown and Band stopped just short of the very summit. 4. Lhotse, Himalayas, Nepal Lhotse is the second-highest peak you can see in this photo, with Mount Everest sitting to it\\\\\\'s right \u00a9Daniel Prudek/Shutterstock Height: 8,516m (27,940ft)First ascent: 18 May 1956 by Fritz Luchsinger and Ernst Reiss It could be argued that Lhotse is not a separate mountain, as it\u2019s at the centre of the gargantuan Everest massif, which also contains the prominent Nuptse (7,861m), as well as the tallest mountain in the world. From Everest basecamp, Lhotse rises at the centre of the Everest, Lhotse, Nuptse horseshoe, its stark walls rising high above the Western Cwm. The most popular route that mountaineers take when climbing Everest climbs the Lhotse Face on the way to the South Col, before the brutal push up to the famous summit.

It was founded by Chaudhary Raghvendra Singh in 1946, and it is based in New Delhi, India.[2][3] DLF has developed residential colonies in Delhi such as Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Krishna Nagar, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony, and Hauz Khas. DLF builds residential, office, and retail properties.[4][5] With the passage of the Delhi Development Act in 1957, the local government assumed control of real estate development and banned private real estate developers from Delhi proper. As a result, DLF began acquiring land at a relatively low cost outside the area controlled by the Delhi Development Authority, in the district of Gurgaon, and in the adjacent state of Haryana. In the mid-1970s, the company started developing their DLF City project at Gurgaon. This included hotels, infrastructure, and special economic zones-related development projects. The company is headed by Rajiv Singh, who is the current chairman of the DLF Group. According to the Forbes listing of richest billionaires in 2023, Kushal Pal Singh, Chairman Emeritus, is the 19th richest man in India with a net worth of US$8.8 billion. The company\\'s $US$2 billion IPO in July 2007 was India\\'s biggest IPO in history.[6] In its first quarter results for the period ending 30 June 2007, the company reported a turnover of \u20b931.2098 billion (US$360 million) and profit after taxes of \u20b915.1548 billion (US$180 million).[7] As of 31 March 2012, the company had 1,380 square feet of leased retail space across the country.[8] In 2013-14, it leased out 3 million sq ft of office space in India.[9][10] History DLF\\'s first residential project was Krishna Nagar in East Delhi, which was completed in 1949. Subsequently, the company developed 21 colonies in Delhi, including Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Punjabi Bagh, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony and Hauz Khas. The passage of Delhi Development Act in 1957 was the first serious challenge to company\\'s growth. The Act meant that the government would assume control of all real estate development activities in the city.[11] As a result, DLF decided to move beyond Delhi and focused on the suburb of Gurgaon in Haryana,[12] which had the potential for development of residential and commercial properties. As DLF started to acquire land under the leadership of Chairman K.P. Singh, Gurgaon embarked on a period of rapid growth.[13] A \u20b958 crore deal was cancelled between DLF and Robert Vadra by IAS officer Ashok Khemka.[14] Sponsorship In 2008, DLF became the title sponsor of the Indian Premier League, a newly formed Twenty20 cricket league. DLF paid close to \u20b92 billion (US$23 million) for the five-year sponsorship deal.[15] The deal ended in the 2012 version of the season, wherein it was taken over by Pepsi. Beyond buildings Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) and DLF, in a 50:50 joint venture, have completed work on a 16-lane, 10.5 km road network in Gurgaon. This stretch from NH8 Toll Plaza to Sector 55/56 in Gurgaon with six underpasses, one flyover and freeways has improved traffic management in the city.[16] To create this\\\\n[Source: dlf.md, ID: dlf_0]\", annotations=None)] isError=False'}",
